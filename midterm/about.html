            <p>
                Hello there! My name is Jeremy Morrell, I am 19 years old and am a student at Bellevue College. I graduated Liberty High School in 2024, after also doing Running Start durning my last two years of High School.

            <p>
                Currently, I go to school at Bellevue College and work at a golf course. This is my first year of attending Bellevue College outside of High School, and I have been enjoying it! 
I also have a job at Fairwood Golf and Country Club, working OSS in the golf department. This April will be my 2nd anniversary of having this job and I love it! I have met so many people and made tons of connections, I get to spend my shift outside in the summer sun, and I love playing golf and being in that environment.

            <p>
                In the future, I see myself going down two different career paths, the first being a firefighter. This profession has always interested me due to the great benefits that firefighters get, as well as the fact that my dad is one of the Renton Fire Commissioners, meaning I have the connections there in front of me should I choose that. 
The other career that I am interested in is video production. I have always been passionate about filming, editing, and directing videos and using the camera.
